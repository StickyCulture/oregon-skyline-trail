# Oregon Skyline Trail

This repository contains various iterations of the historic [Oregon Skyline Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Skyline_Trail) in GeoJSON format with accompanying GeoTIFF maps.

The Skyline Trail was the precursor to the Pacific Crest Trail in Oregon. It was established in the 1920s by connecting a network of trails that had been used for centuries by Indigenous peoples, fur traders, ranchers, and logging operations.
